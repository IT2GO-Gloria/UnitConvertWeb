### Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Web Browser

### This app has the Metric System and the US Customary System for:
* Fahrenheit to Celsius
* Inches to Centimeters
* Liters to Gallons
* Miles to Kilometers

### This App:
* The home page shows some history about the metric system and the US Customary System,
* The home page also allows the user to pick which conversion they want,
* Each page has two images which goes along with the page,
* Each conversion page gives history about user's conversion,
* After the user enters their number the conversion is displayed, and
* A user can keep going between the conversion pages and do other conversions or quit.

### Future Phases should:
* Add more conversions,
* Allow conversions to go both ways,
* Add sections like: money conversions, baking conversions, etc.
* Add a background that goes with the conversions requested,
* Anything else that will improve the user experience.
